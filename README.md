Within this repo we aim to solve different problems proposed on https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge.

Cultural Trends: By adding a diverse set of cities, we want participants to compare and contrast what makes a particular city different. For example, are people in international cities less concerned about driving in to a business, indicated by their lack of mention about parking? What cuisines are Yelpers raving about in these different countries? Do Americans tend to eat out late compared to the Germans and English? In which countries are Yelpers sticklers for service quality? In international cities such as Montreal, are French speakers reviewing places differently than English speakers?
